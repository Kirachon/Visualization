# Story 1.3 — Dashboard Builder (Frontend) Implementation Summary

Status: Ready for Review
Date: 2025-10-05
Author: Augment Agent (GPT‑5 via Augment Code)

What was implemented
- Pages: DashboardListPage (search/filter/pagination, create/edit/delete), DashboardCreatePage, DashboardEditPage
- Builder: react-grid-layout canvas (drag/resize), component palette (Bar/Line/Pie/Table), configuration panel (bindings, formatting), undo/redo, debounced autosave, read-only banner and permission guard, share indicator
- State/Services: dashboardsSlice, builderSlice (history, dirty, selection), dashboardService (CRUD + patch), types
- i18n scaffold and ErrorBoundary for builder area
- A11y: keyboard navigation for palette and canvas items, ARIA attributes, visible focus rings
- Perf: debounced autosave, reduced layout churn (save on drag/resize stop), memo-friendly props

Testing
- Unit: reducers (builder, dashboards), ConfigPanel validation, Palette keyboard/click, ErrorBoundary
- Integration: DashboardEditPage flow (load → add component → autosave via patch)
- All apps/web tests pass (npm test); prod build OK (npm run build)

Notes & follow-ups
- Real chart renderers (D3/Recharts) and advanced config move to Story 1.4
- Global coverage threshold remains <80% due to legacy areas; new builder code has high coverage; additional tests can be added if we raise global coverage targets now
- ShareIndicator supports optional backend shares endpoint if available; otherwise relies on meta.isShared
