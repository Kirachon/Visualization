# Security and Performance

### Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';`
- XSS Prevention: React's built-in XSS protection + DOMPurify for user content
- Secure Storage: Use httpOnly cookies for tokens, avoid localStorage for sensitive data
- Authentication: JWT tokens with short expiration + refresh token pattern

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Comprehensive validation using Joi/Zod schemas
- Rate Limiting: Express-rate-limit with user-based limits
- CORS Policy: Strict CORS with allowed origins
- API Security: Kong API gateway with security plugins

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: httpOnly cookies with secure flag
- Session Management: Redis-based session store
- Password Policy: Enforce strong passwords via Keycloak
- Multi-Factor: Optional TOTP-based MFA

### Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: <2MB initial load, <500KB subsequent loads
- Loading Strategy: Code splitting with React.lazy and dynamic imports
- Caching Strategy: Service worker for static assets, browser cache for API responses
- Performance Monitoring: Web Vitals tracking with real user monitoring

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <500ms for API calls, <5s for complex queries
- Database Optimization: ClickHouse for analytics, connection pooling for PostgreSQL
- Caching Strategy: Redis for query results, application-level caching for expensive operations
- Load Balancing: Horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU/memory metrics
