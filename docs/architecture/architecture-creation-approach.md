# Architecture Creation Approach

I'll create a detailed architecture document that addresses:

1. **High-level architecture** - Overall system design and component relationships
2. **Technology stack** - Specific technologies with versions and rationale
3. **Data models** - Schema designs for analytics and metadata
4. **Component architecture** - Microservices and their responsibilities
5. **API specifications** - REST/GraphQL interfaces
6. **Database schemas** - ClickHouse and PostgreSQL designs
7. **Frontend architecture** - React components and state management
8. **Infrastructure design** - Kubernetes deployment and scaling
9. **Security implementation** - Authentication, authorization, and data protection
10. **Development workflow** - Local setup and CI/CD pipeline

Let me begin creating the comprehensive architecture document:
