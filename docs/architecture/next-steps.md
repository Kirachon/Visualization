# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Please create a comprehensive UI/UX specification for this open-source BI platform, focusing on creating an intuitive, powerful analytics interface that balances sophisticated capabilities with ease of use. Include detailed user flows for dashboard creation, data exploration, and collaboration features.

### Product Owner Prompt

Please validate this architecture document against the PRD requirements and create a comprehensive product backlog with detailed user stories for development teams. Focus on ensuring all functional requirements are addressed with appropriate technical implementations.

I've created a comprehensive fullstack architecture document for your open-source BI platform that includes:

1. **Complete system architecture** with microservices design and component relationships
2. **Detailed technology stack** with specific versions and rationale for each choice
3. **Data models** with TypeScript interfaces for all major entities
4. **Component architecture** for both frontend and backend services
5. **API specifications** with OpenAPI documentation for REST endpoints
6. **Database schemas** for both ClickHouse (analytics) and PostgreSQL (metadata)
7. **Project structure** for a monorepo with clear organization
8. **Development workflow** with local setup and environment configuration
9. **Deployment architecture** with CI/CD pipeline and Kubernetes deployment
10. **Security and performance** considerations with implementation details
11. **Testing strategy** with examples for unit, integration, and E2E tests
12. **Error handling** with comprehensive strategies for both frontend and backend
13. **Monitoring and observability** with specific tools and metrics

The architecture is designed to support all requirements from the PRD while maintaining vendor neutrality and open-source compliance. It provides a solid foundation for development teams to implement the platform incrementally through the defined phases.
