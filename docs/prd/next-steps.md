# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Please create a comprehensive UI/UX specification for this open-source BI platform, focusing on creating an intuitive, powerful analytics interface that balances sophisticated capabilities with ease of use. Include detailed user flows for dashboard creation, data exploration, and collaboration features.

### Architect Prompt

Please create a comprehensive fullstack architecture document for this open-source BI platform, including detailed technical specifications for the microservices architecture, data processing pipelines, security implementation, and scalability considerations. Ensure the architecture supports all functional requirements while maintaining vendor neutrality and open-source compliance.

I've created a comprehensive PRD that transforms our brainstorming results into a structured development plan. The PRD includes:

- **Clear goals and context** for the open-source BI platform
- **12 functional requirements** covering all major features
- **10 non-functional requirements** for performance and security
- **UI design goals** focusing on professional analytics experience
- **Technical assumptions** based on our recommended technology stack
- **5 epics** with 25 detailed stories covering MVP to production readiness

Each story includes specific acceptance criteria that will guide development and testing. The phased approach ensures we can deliver value incrementally while building toward a comprehensive enterprise solution.
