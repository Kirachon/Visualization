# Open-Source Business Intelligence Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create a fully open-source BI platform that rivals commercial solutions like Tableau and Qlik
- Provide comprehensive data visualization and analytics capabilities without vendor lock-in
- Support enterprise-grade features including security, scalability, and collaboration
- Enable organizations to build and share interactive dashboards using multiple data sources
- Maintain vendor neutrality and cloud-agnostic deployment options
- Deliver sub-second query performance on billion-row datasets
- Support both real-time and batch data processing workflows

### Background Context

The Business Intelligence market is dominated by proprietary solutions with high licensing costs and vendor lock-in. Organizations need powerful analytics capabilities but face barriers including expensive licenses, data portability issues, and limited customization options. 

This open-source BI platform addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive, enterprise-grade solution that can be deployed on any infrastructure (cloud or on-premises) while maintaining full control over data and customization. The platform leverages modern open-source technologies including ClickHouse for analytics, React for the frontend, and Kubernetes for deployment to deliver performance comparable to commercial solutions.
