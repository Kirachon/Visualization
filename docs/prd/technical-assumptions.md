# Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing frontend, backend services, and infrastructure configuration. Facilitates shared code, consistent tooling, and simplified deployment.

### Service Architecture: Microservices

Decomposed into specialized services (dashboard, data, user management, alerts) that can be scaled independently. Communication via REST APIs and event streaming.

### Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid

Unit tests for individual components, integration tests for service interactions, and end-to-end tests for critical user journeys. Target 80% code coverage.

### Additional Technical Assumptions

- **Primary Analytics Database**: ClickHouse for columnar storage and query performance
- **Metadata Storage**: PostgreSQL for user data, dashboard configurations, and system metadata
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for session management and query result caching
- **Real-time Processing**: Apache Kafka for data streaming and Apache Flink for stream processing
- **Batch ETL**: Apache Airflow for scheduled data transformations
- **Container Platform**: Docker for containerization with Kubernetes for orchestration
- **API Gateway**: Kong for routing, authentication, and rate limiting
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging
