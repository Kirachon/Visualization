# Story 5.4: Production Deployment Automation

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want automated, zero-downtime deployments (Kubernetes + Helm + CI/CD) so that releases are safe and repeatable.

## Scope
- In-scope: K8s manifests/Helm, CI/CD pipelines, blue-green/rolling, backups/DR, config/secrets, rollback/runbooks.
- Out-of-scope: Multi-cloud portability (keep charts portable).

## Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)
1) Kubernetes & Helm
- Given Helm charts
- When deploying
- Then API/Web/DB/Redis/Kafka deploy with health checks, liveness/readiness probes

2) CI/CD
- Given pushes/PRs/tags
- When pipeline runs
- Then lint/test/build/scan/image-push/deploy execute with approvals on main

3) Blue-Green & Rolling
- Given production
- When deploying
- Then traffic shifts via blue-green or rolling with health checks and automatic rollback on failures

4) Backups & DR
- Given scheduled backups
- When DR tested
- Then RTO < 1h and restore validated quarterly

5) Secrets & Config
- Given environment-specific values
- When deployed
- Then ConfigMaps/Secrets/Vault integrate and rotate

## Artifacts
- infrastructure/kubernetes/*; infrastructure/helm/*; .github/workflows/ci.yml

## Security
- Image signing/verification (cosign); least-privileged service accounts; network policies

## Observability
- Deploy metrics (success, duration); change failure rate; MTTR; deployment dashboards

## Performance
- Deployment time p95 < 10m; no error-rate spike > 0.5% during rollout

## Rollout/Backout
- Blue-green switch; helm rollback; runbooks for incident

## Risks & Mitigations
- R: Config drift -> M: GitOps practices; immutable images
- R: Secret exposure -> M: sealed secrets/Vault + least privilege

## Testing Strategy
- Unit: helm template lint; policy tests (OPA Gatekeeper)
- Integration: staging deploy; smoke tests
- E2E: blue-green switch, rollback drill

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. Helm charts for API/Web/DB/Redis/Kafka
2. CI/CD pipeline (lint/test/build/scan/deploy)
3. Blue-green scripts + traffic shift
4. Backup/DR scripts + docs
5. Secrets management integration
6. Dashboards and runbooks
7. Tests + drills

## NFRs
- Security: signed images; policy checks
- Reliability: rollbacks; DR tested

## DoD
- [ ] Charts published; CI/CD green
- [ ] Blue-green/rolling validated
- [ ] DR drill pass
- [ ] Tests >= 80%
