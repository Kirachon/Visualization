# Story 5.3: Advanced Monitoring & Observability

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want metrics, logs, and traces with dashboards and SLAs so that platform health is continuously visible.

## Scope
- In-scope: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, OpenTelemetry tracing, ELK logs, APM, infra monitoring, business KPIs, SLA reporting.
- Out-of-scope: External vendor-specific features (kept pluggable).

## Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)
1) Metrics
- Given API and workers
- When metrics export is enabled
- Then Prometheus scrapes app metrics and Grafana shows system + app dashboards

2) Tracing
- Given distributed requests
- When tracing is on
- Then traces appear in Jaeger/Zipkin with spans across services and DB calls

3) Logging
- Given structured logs
- When shipped to ELK
- Then Kibana provides search, saved queries, and alerts on patterns

4) APM
- Given APM agent
- When installed
- Then slow transactions, error traces, and DB timings are captured

5) Business KPIs
- Given events
- When aggregated
- Then dashboards show active users, dashboards created, queries executed per tenant

6) SLA Monitoring
- Given SLOs
- When measured
- Then uptime, latency p95, and error rate are tracked and monthly SLA reports generated

## Components
- Prometheus + prom-client exports; Grafana dashboards (json)
- OpenTelemetry SDK + collector -> Jaeger
- Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana; Winston structured logs
- Datadog/New Relic APM optional

## APIs
- /metrics (Prometheus)
- /api/v1/observability/sla [GET]
- /api/v1/observability/kpi [GET]

## Security
- Redact secrets; restrict /metrics; encrypt logs at rest; PII minimization

## Observability for Observability
- Metrics: metrics.scrape.errors, tracing.export.errors, log.drops

## Performance
- Metrics scraping overhead < 5%; tracing sampling 10% default

## Rollout/Backout
- Gradual enablement of tracing sampling; feature flags for APM

## Risks & Mitigations
- R: High cardinality metrics -> M: label policies
- R: Log costs -> M: retention + sampling

## UX/Design
- MonitoringDashboard page embeds Grafana and shows SLAs/KPIs

## Testing Strategy
- Unit: metrics wrappers; trace decorators
- Integration: scrape/traces/log shipping in docker-compose
- E2E: SLA calc over test period

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. Metrics exports + dashboards
2. Tracing setup + propagation
3. Log shipping + dashboards
4. KPI service + UI
5. SLA calc + reports
6. Tests + docs

## NFRs
- Security: redaction; RBAC on observability UIs
- Reliability: buffering for log shipping; retry exporters

## DoD
- [ ] Dashboards live (metrics/logs/traces)
- [ ] SLA + KPI endpoints
- [ ] Tests >= 80%
