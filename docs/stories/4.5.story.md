# Story 4.5: Data Quality Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a data quality manager, I want rule-based and statistical data quality monitoring so that data reliability is ensured and improved.

## Scope
- In-scope: Rules, profiling, scoring/trending, anomaly alerts, RCA, recommendations, dashboards.
- Out-of-scope: External DQ tools (future integration connectors).

## Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)
1) Rules
- Given tables and columns
- When I configure rules (completeness/accuracy/consistency/timeliness)
- Then evaluations run on schedule and results store with pass/fail

2) Profiling
- Given datasets
- When profiling runs
- Then statistics (count, distinct, null%, min/max, avg, stddev, patterns) are computed

3) Scoring & Trends
- Given rule results
- When aggregated
- Then quality score 0-100 per asset is computed and trending charts show over time

4) Alerts
- Given thresholds or anomalies
- When violated
- Then alerts are raised (reuse 4.4) with context and suggested actions

5) RCA
- Given recurring failures
- When RCA runs
- Then likely causes and impacted dashboards are listed

6) Recommendations
- Given issues
- When generating recommendations
- Then fixes (indices, constraints, ETL checks) are proposed

## Data Model / Migrations
- dq_rules(id, asset_id, type, config jsonb, schedule, owner_id)
- dq_results(id, rule_id, status, metrics jsonb, at)
- dq_profiles(id, asset_id, stats jsonb, at)
- dq_scores(id, asset_id, score, at)
- dq_rca(id, asset_id, cause jsonb, at)
- dq_recommendations(id, asset_id, rec jsonb, at)

## APIs
- /api/v1/dq/rules [CRUD]
- /api/v1/dq/results?assetId= [GET]
- /api/v1/dq/profiles?assetId= [GET]
- /api/v1/dq/scores?assetId= [GET]

## Processing
- Rule engine; profiling jobs; scoring aggregator; RCA analyzer; recommendation generator

## Security
- Respect RBAC; donâ€™t expose raw PII in profiles; mask samples

## Observability
- Metrics: dq.rules.executed, dq.failures, dq.score.avg

## Performance
- Profiling large tables via sampling; full scans off-peak

## Rollout/Backout
- Module flag; dry-run rules before enforcement

## Risks & Mitigations
- R: Costly full scans -> M: sampling + schedules
- R: False positives -> M: thresholds + suppression windows

## UX/Design
- DataQualityDashboard page: scorecards, sparkline trends, issues list, recs

## Testing Strategy
- Unit: rule evaluators, profilers
- Integration: scheduled runs, aggregator
- E2E: end-to-end issue to alert to recommendation

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. Models + APIs
2. Rule engine + scheduler
3. Profiling jobs
4. Scoring aggregator + trends
5. RCA + recommendations
6. Dashboards + UI
7. Tests + docs

## NFRs
- Security: masking; RBAC
- Reliability: retries; idempotent runs

## DoD
- [ ] Rules + profiles + scores operational
- [ ] Alerts + RCA + recs available
- [ ] Tests >= 80%
