# Story 3.5: Advanced Security Features

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a compliance officer, I want field-level encryption, tamper-proof audit, retention, GDPR tools, vulnerability scanning, network monitoring, and compliance reporting so that regulations are met.

## Scope
- In-scope: Encryption, audit integrity, retention, GDPR RTBF/export, scanning, IDS, reports.
- Out-of-scope: External GRC platforms (future integration).

## Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)
1) Field-Level Encryption
- Given sensitive fields
- When stored
- Then AES-256-GCM encrypts with rotating keys; decrypt only in privileged flows

2) Tamper-Proof Audit
- Given audit logs
- When appended
- Then hash chain ensures integrity; verification job detects tampering

3) Retention Policies
- Given policy per data type
- When retention expires
- Then automated cleanup runs with reports and exceptions list

4) GDPR Tools
- Given RTBF request
- When executed
- Then all PII for subject is erased (or anonymized when required) with evidence; export produces subject archive

5) Vulnerability Scanning
- Given daily scans
- When vulnerabilities detected
- Then alerts created and dashboard shows trend by severity

6) Network Monitoring
- Given suspicious activities
- When detected (e.g., brute force, injection patterns)
- Then IDS raises incidents and blocks IPs beyond threshold

7) Compliance Reporting
- Given auditors
- When reports generated
- Then SOC2/ISO27001/GDPR evidence bundles are exported

## Data Model / Migrations
- encryption_keys(id, kid, algo, created_at, rotated_at, status)
- audit_logs(id, user_id, action, resource, details jsonb, at, prev_hash, hash)
- retention_policies(id, data_type, ttl_days, hard_delete boolean)
- gdpr_requests(id, subject_id, type:'rtbf'|'export', status, created_at, completed_at)
- vuln_findings(id, source, severity, package, version, cve, at, status)
- ids_events(id, type, src_ip, metadata jsonb, at, action)

## Services/APIs
- EncryptionService: encrypt/decrypt; key rotation; envelope keys via KMS/Vault
- AuditService: append with hash chain; verify endpoint /api/v1/audit/verify
- RetentionService: schedule cleanup; /api/v1/retention/policies [CRUD]
- GDPRService: /api/v1/gdpr/requests [POST/GET], execute
- SecurityScanService: integrate Snyk/OWASP; store findings
- NetworkSecurityService: detect anomalies; blocklist API
- ComplianceReportingService: generate bundles

## Security
- HSM/KMS-backed master keys; access control; dual-control for key ops; encrypted backups

## Observability
- Metrics: encryption.ops, audit.append, retention.deleted, gdpr.completed, vuln.count, ids.blocks
- Alerts on tamper detection, failed decrypt, overdue RTBF

## Performance
- Encrypt/decrypt adds < 10% overhead typical; audit append < 5ms p95

## Rollout/Backout
- Progressive enablement; dry-run for retention and RTBF

## Risks & Mitigations
- R: RTBF completeness -> M: data map + automated scans
- R: Key loss -> M: KMS backups, disaster recovery runbooks

## UX/Design
- Security Dashboard: vulns trend, IDS events, RTBF queue, audit integrity status
- Compliance Manager: policy editor, report generator

## Testing Strategy
- Unit: crypto wrappers, hash chain
- Integration: RTBF over sample data, retention dry-run
- E2E: auditor flow generating reports

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. Crypto wrappers + key mgmt
2. Audit hash chain + verify job
3. Retention jobs + policy CRUD
4. GDPR RTBF/export flows
5. Scanning + IDS integration
6. Compliance reporting + UIs
7. Tests + docs

## NFRs
- Security: FIPS-validated ciphers; least privilege
- Reliability: retries; idempotent RTBF; audit immutability

## DoD
- [ ] Encryption + audit integrity operational
- [ ] RTBF/export end-to-end
- [ ] Scanning + IDS with alerts
- [ ] Tests >= 85%
