# Story 4.1: ETL Pipeline Framework

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a data engineer, I want a visual ETL framework (designer, 50+ transforms, scheduling, monitoring) so that pipelines are reliable and maintainable.

## Scope
- In-scope: Airflow integration, visual designer, transforms library, scheduling/deps, retries, monitoring, data quality validators.
- Out-of-scope: Cloud-managed ETL services (future connectors).

## Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)
1) Visual Designer
- Given the Pipeline Designer
- When I drag nodes (Extract/Transform/Load/Validate) and connect them
- Then a valid DAG is synthesized with validation errors highlighted

2) Airflow Orchestration
- Given a saved pipeline
- When I publish
- Then an Airflow DAG is generated/deployed and executions reflect status in UI

3) Scheduling & Dependencies
- Given cron and dependencies
- When configured
- Then tasks execute in order with concurrency limits and backfills supported

4) Retries & Error Handling
- Given transient failures
- When they occur
- Then retries with exponential backoff happen and alerts are sent after max retries

5) Monitoring
- Given running pipelines
- When viewed in UI
- Then durations, success rate, last run, next run, and logs are visible

6) Data Quality
- Given validators
- When attached to pipeline
- Then failing checks fail pipeline or mark warnings per policy

## Data Model / Storage
- pipelines(id, tenant_id, name, graph jsonb, version, schedule, owner_id, created_at, updated_at)
- pipeline_runs(id, pipeline_id, status, started_at, ended_at, metrics jsonb)
- pipeline_alerts(id, pipeline_id, run_id, level, message, at)

## APIs
- /api/v1/pipelines [CRUD]
- /api/v1/pipelines/:id/publish [POST]
- /api/v1/pipelines/:id/runs [GET]
- /api/v1/pipelines/:id/alerts [GET]

## Transforms Library (50+)
- Extract: JDBC, file, API, CDC
- Transform: map/filter/aggregate/join/pivot/window/enrich/validate/schema-evolve
- Load: DB insert/upsert, file sinks, warehouse loads

## Architecture
- Designer: React (react-flow) with schema-aware connectors
- Compiler: DAG generator to Airflow Python DAG (templated)
- Runtime: Airflow with CeleryExecutor; logs streamed to UI

## Security
- Secrets via Vault; least-privileged service accounts; signed DAGs

## Observability
- Metrics: run.duration, task.retries, dq.failures
- Logs shipped to ELK; traces around compile/publish

## Performance
- DAG compile < 5s; monitor update latency < 2s

## Rollout/Backout
- Feature flag per tenant; keep legacy import/export path during rollout

## Risks & Mitigations
- R: DAG drift -> M: hash verification; re-publish guard
- R: Designer complexity -> M: validation and templates

## UX/Design
- Canvas/grid; palette with search; node inspector; run panel with logs

## Testing Strategy
- Unit: compiler; validators
- Integration: publish to local Airflow; run happy/fail paths
- E2E: build-run-monitor full flow

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. Designer UI
2. Compiler to Airflow
3. Runtime integration + logs
4. Validators + policy
5. Monitoring UI
6. Tests + docs

## NFRs
- Security: secret isolation; signed artifacts
- Reliability: retries; idempotent publish

## DoD
- [ ] Designer usable; DAGs publish and run
- [ ] Monitoring shows accurate states
- [ ] 20+ transforms available initially (target 50+)
- [ ] Tests >= 80%
