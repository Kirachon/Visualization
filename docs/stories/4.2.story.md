# Story 4.2: Real-time Data Streaming

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a data engineer, I want Kafka + Debezium CDC + Flink stream processing so that live data is delivered and transformed reliably.

## Scope
- In-scope: Kafka cluster, Debezium connectors, Flink jobs, validation/cleansing, monitoring, backpressure, replay.
- Out-of-scope: UI viz of streams (covered elsewhere).

## Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)
1) Kafka Integration
- Given topics configured
- When producers publish
- Then consumers receive with at-least-once semantics

2) Debezium CDC
- Given source databases
- When CDC is enabled
- Then change events (create/update/delete) are streamed with schema metadata

3) Flink Processing
- Given streaming jobs
- When transformations defined (filter/map/aggregate/window)
- Then outputs are written to sinks (DB/warehouse/topics) with exactly-once where configured

4) Validation & Cleansing
- Given quality rules
- When applied to streams
- Then invalid records are quarantined with reasons; metrics reflect reject rates

5) Monitoring & Metrics
- Given running pipelines
- When viewing monitoring
- Then lag, throughput, error rates, and watermarking are visible with alerts

6) Backpressure & Replay
- Given surges
- When load spikes
- Then backpressure controls flow without loss; replay recent data by offset/time

## Infrastructure
- Kafka 3.5, 3 brokers, RF=3; Schema Registry
- Debezium 2.4 connectors (Postgres/MySQL)
- Flink 1.17 cluster; checkpoints every 5 min; state backend: RocksDB

## Data Model / Topics
- topics: cdc.{db}.{table}; dlq.{pipeline}; metrics.streaming
- Offsets tracked per consumer group

## APIs
- /api/v1/streaming/pipelines [GET]
- /api/v1/streaming/metrics [GET]
- /api/v1/streaming/replay [POST] { topic, fromOffset|fromTime, toOffset? }

## Security
- mTLS between brokers/clients; ACLs; topic-level authz; PII redaction in DLQ

## Observability
- Metrics: lag, throughput, errors, watermark, checkpoint.duration
- Traces: producer->processor->sink

## Performance
- Throughput: > 50k msgs/s aggregate; end-to-end p95 < 1s under normal load

## Rollout/Backout
- Topic by topic enablement; backout by disabling connectors/jobs

## Risks & Mitigations
- R: Schema evolution -> M: schema registry compat mode + adapters
- R: DLQ growth -> M: retention + compaction policies

## Testing Strategy
- Unit: transforms; serializers
- Integration: Debezium on docker DBs; Flink job with test harness
- E2E: CDC->Kafka->Flink->Sink happy path; replay; failure recovery

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. Kafka cluster + registry
2. Debezium connectors
3. Flink job templates
4. Validation/quarantine path
5. Monitoring dashboard + alerts
6. Replay API
7. Tests + docs

## NFRs
- Security: mTLS, ACLs; no secrets in events
- Reliability: checkpoints, exactly-once where needed; DLQ

## DoD
- [ ] End-to-end streaming operational
- [ ] Monitoring meets SLOs
- [ ] Replay verified
- [ ] Tests >= 80%
