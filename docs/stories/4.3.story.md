# Story 4.3: Advanced Scheduling & Automation

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a data analyst, I want advanced scheduling (cron, dependencies, conditional, overrides) so that refreshes are timely and efficient.

## Scope
- In-scope: Cron/time zones, dependency DAGs, conditions, monitoring, overrides, logs.
- Out-of-scope: Airflow orchestration (4.1 already covers pipelines).

## Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)
1) Cron & Time Zones
- Given a schedule form
- When I enter a cron and timezone
- Then next run preview shows accurately and jobs run accordingly

2) Dependencies
- Given task dependencies
- When configured
- Then ordering is enforced and parallelism allowed where no deps

3) Conditional Runs
- Given conditions (data available, prior success)
- When evaluated
- Then jobs skip or run with reason logged

4) Overrides
- Given a scheduled job
- When I pause/resume/run-now
- Then overrides take effect with audit

5) Monitoring
- Given scheduled jobs
- When viewed
- Then success rate, durations, and failure reasons are visible with alerts

## Data Model / Migrations
- schedules(id, subject_type, subject_id, cron, timezone, enabled, created_at)
- schedule_runs(id, schedule_id, status, started_at, ended_at, logs)
- schedule_dependencies(schedule_id, depends_on_schedule_id)
- schedule_conditions(id, schedule_id, type, expression)

## APIs
- /api/v1/schedules [CRUD]
- /api/v1/schedules/:id/run-now [POST]
- /api/v1/schedules/:id/pause [POST]
- /api/v1/schedules/:id/resume [POST]

## Architecture
- SchedulerService parses cron (node-cron), resolves deps, enqueues jobs into Bull queue; workers execute

## Security
- Role checks for overrides; audit all actions

## Observability
- Metrics: schedule.run.duration, success_rate, queue.depth

## Performance
- Trigger jitter < 500ms; queue latency < 1s

## Rollout/Backout
- Gradual enablement per subject type

## Risks & Mitigations
- R: Cron errors -> M: parser + preview validation
- R: Timezone drift -> M: TZ database updates

## UX/Design
- ScheduleManager page; cron helper; dependency graph

## Testing Strategy
- Unit: cron parser wrappers, condition evaluator
- Integration: queue workers; dep order
- E2E: pause/run-now flows

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. Models + API
2. SchedulerService + workers
3. Monitoring + UI
4. Overrides + audit
5. Tests + docs

## NFRs
- Security: authz; audit
- Reliability: persistent queue; retry with backoff

## DoD
- [ ] Schedules run reliably
- [ ] Overrides audited
- [ ] Tests >= 80%
