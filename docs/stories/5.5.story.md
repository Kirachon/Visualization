# Story 5.5: Enterprise Support & Documentation

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a product manager, I want comprehensive documentation, training, and support/SLA programs so that enterprise adoption succeeds.

## Scope
- In-scope: OpenAPI docs, user/admin/dev docs, docs site, community/support channels, training/certification, SLAs/escalations.
- Out-of-scope: Paid billing/CRM integration (future).

## Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)
1) API Documentation
- Given API annotations
- When docs generated
- Then OpenAPI 3.0 spec and Swagger UI are available with examples and auth flows

2) User/Admin/Dev Docs
- Given documentation structure
- When content authored
- Then user guides, admin guides, and developer guides are published with search and versioning

3) Docs Site
- Given Docusaurus site
- When deployed
- Then docs.biplatform.com hosts versioned docs with search and CI publish pipeline

4) Community & Support
- Given support plan
- When channels created
- Then forum, email, and ticketing work with SLAs and escalation paths

5) Training & Certification
- Given curriculum
- When courses/exams published
- Then users can complete training and receive certifications

6) SLA & Escalation
- Given enterprise support tiers
- When incidents occur
- Then response times and escalation procedures are followed and reported

## Artifacts & Structure
- docs/user-guide/*, docs/admin-guide/*, docs/developer-guide/*, docs/training/*, docs/api/*
- docs-site/ (Docusaurus) with CI workflow
- OpenAPI in apps/api/src/openapi/*

## APIs
- /api/v1/docs/openapi.json
- /api/v1/support/tickets [CRUD]
- /api/v1/support/sla [GET]

## Security
- Redact secrets in examples; indicate scopes/roles; rate-limit ticket endpoints

## Observability
- Metrics: docs.page.views, search.queries, ticket.created/closed, sla.violations

## Performance
- Docs site TTI < 3s globally via CDN; search < 200ms

## Rollout/Backout
- Staged content releases; can revert to prior docs version

## Risks & Mitigations
- R: Stale docs -> M: docs-as-code, PR checks
- R: SLA breaches -> M: paging + dashboards

## UX/Design
- Clear IA, breadcrumbs, copy-checked; code snippets validated in CI

## Testing Strategy
- Unit: OpenAPI schema validation
- Integration: Docs build CI; link checker; code sample tests
- E2E: ticket SLAs honored in staging drills

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. OpenAPI annotations + generation
2. Docusaurus site + theme + search + versioning
3. User/Admin/Dev content authoring
4. Support ticket system + SLAs
5. Training courses + exams
6. CI publishing + link checking
7. Tests + governance

## NFRs
- Security: redaction; least privilege
- Reliability: docs publishing rollback; ticket uptime SLO 99.9%

## DoD
- [ ] OpenAPI + Swagger live
- [ ] Docs site live with versioning
- [ ] Support channels + SLAs active
- [ ] Training live
- [ ] Tests >= 80%
