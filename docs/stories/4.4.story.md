# Story 4.4: Intelligent Alerting System

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a business user, I want intelligent, multi-channel alerts (rules + anomalies) so that I can react quickly to significant changes.

## Scope
- In-scope: Rule engine, anomaly detection, channels (email/Slack/SMS/webhook), escalation/suppression, history/analytics, incident integration.
- Out-of-scope: Company-wide incident management playbooks (integrate with PagerDuty/Opsgenie only).

## Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)
1) Rule-Based Alerts
- Given a KPI
- When threshold or trend conditions match
- Then an alert is created and notifications are sent per channel

2) Anomaly Detection
- Given a metric stream
- When anomalies occur (Isolation Forest/LSTM)
- Then alerts are raised with confidence score and context

3) Channels
- Given recipients and channels
- When alert triggers
- Then email/Slack/SMS/webhook messages are delivered with dedup

4) Escalation & Suppression
- Given policies
- When alerts repeat or are silenced windows
- Then escalations or suppressions apply

5) History & Analytics
- Given past alerts
- When viewing dashboard
- Then trends by severity, MTTA/MTTR, and recipient fatigue are visible

6) Incident Integration
- Given PagerDuty/Opsgenie
- When critical alert triggers
- Then an incident is created/updated

## Data Model / Migrations
- alerts(id, tenant_id, name, subject_ref, condition jsonb, channels[], enabled)
- alert_events(id, alert_id, severity, message, data jsonb, created_at)
- deliveries(id, event_id, channel, status, attempts, last_error)
- suppressions(id, alert_id, window_start, window_end)
- escalations(id, alert_id, policy jsonb)

## APIs
- /api/v1/alerts [CRUD]
- /api/v1/alerts/:id/test [POST]
- /api/v1/alerts/:id/history [GET]
- /api/v1/alerts/:id/suppress [POST]

## Rule Engine
- Operators: >, <, >=, <=, delta%, trend slope; windows: 5m, 1h, 24h; aggregations: avg, p95

## Anomaly Detection
- Offline training weekly; online scoring; thresholds configurable by KPI

## Channels
- Email (Nodemailer), Slack (@slack/web-api), SMS (Twilio), webhook (signed payload)

## Security
- Signed webhooks; rate limits; PII redaction in payloads; least privilege creds

## Observability
- Metrics: alerts.triggered, deliveries.success/failure, anomalies.count

## Performance
- Trigger latency < 30s; delivery retries with backoff

## Rollout/Backout
- Module flag; backout disables triggers; deliveries drained gracefully

## Risks & Mitigations
- R: Alert noise -> M: dedup/suppression; anomaly tuning
- R: Delivery failures -> M: retries + DLQ

## UX/Design
- AlertManager page; condition builder; channel config; history charts

## Testing Strategy
- Unit: rule evaluator, anomaly scorer
- Integration: delivery channels (mocks)
- E2E: end-to-end alert trigger to incident creation

## Tasks / Subtasks
1. Models + APIs
2. Rule engine + scheduler
3. Anomaly detection service
4. Channels + integrations
5. UI + history dashboards
6. Tests + docs

## NFRs
- Security: signed webhooks; audit
- Reliability: retries; DLQ

## DoD
- [ ] Rules + anomalies functional
- [ ] Channels deliver reliably
- [ ] Incident integration works
- [ ] Tests >= 80%
