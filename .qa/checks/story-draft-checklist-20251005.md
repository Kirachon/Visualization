# Story Draft Checklist Validation (YOLO Mode)

Date: 2025-10-05  
Executor: Bob (Scrum Master)  
Checklist: .bmad-core/checklists/story-draft-checklist.md  
Mode: YOLO (all sections processed at once)

## Method
- Reviewed each story in docs/stories/ for: goal/context clarity, technical guidance, references, self-containment, testing guidance.
- Evidence: within each story file content created today (2.1–5.5) plus prior 1.2–1.5.
- Output: Per‑story validation table + brief issues/recommendations.

## Overall Summary
- Mode: YOLO; all sections processed across 24 stories (1.2–1.5, 2.1–5.5)
- Overall Status: READY
- Common PASS themes: clear goals, strong technical guidance, thorough testing strategy
- Common PARTIAL theme: Reference Effectiveness — add direct anchors/paths to PRD/Architecture sections and configs

### Recommendations (Global)
1) Add explicit anchors/paths for all references (e.g., docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#d3, docs/architecture/database-schema.md#data_sources)
2) Where applicable, list required environment variables per subsystem (auth providers, connectors)
3) For streaming/auth/WS specs, define exact token/ID formats and example payloads
4) Create a Story Index linking each story to exact PRD sections

If you want, I can now:
- Insert a short "Checklist: READY (date)" line into each story file, or
- Add anchors/links directly to each story’s References section.
