## Security Assessment

**Status:** ❌ **FAIL**  
**Score:** 40/100  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

### Security Requirements

| Requirement | Status | Evidence | Notes |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------|
| Authentication & Authorization | ⚠️ PARTIAL | JWT tokens, role-based access | Token storage insecure |
| Data Protection | ⚠️ PARTIAL | HTTPS/TLS, password hashing | Token exposure via localStorage |
| Input Validation | ❌ FAIL | Basic null checks only | Missing validation schemas |
| Session Management | ⚠️ PARTIAL | JWT with expiration | httpOnly cookies not used on frontend |
| Secure Communication | ✅ PASS | TLS 1.2/1.3, HTTPS | Proper cipher configuration |
| Error Handling | ✅ PASS | No sensitive data in errors | Good error abstraction |
| Logging & Monitoring | ✅ PASS | Structured logging, audit trail | Request tracking implemented |

### Critical Security Issues

#### 1. Token Storage Vulnerability (CRITICAL)
- **Issue:** JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- **Risk:** XSS attacks can steal tokens
- **Impact:** Complete account compromise
- **Evidence:** `apps/web/src/services/api.ts:16`, `apps/web/src/services/authService.ts:11-14`
- **Requirement Violated:** Story security requirements (line 342) - "Use httpOnly cookies for JWT token storage (NOT localStorage)"
- **Fix Required:** Remove localStorage usage, rely on httpOnly cookies

#### 2. Missing Input Validation (HIGH)
- **Issue:** No validation schemas (Joi/Zod)
- **Risk:** Injection attacks, data corruption
- **Impact:** Security breach, data integrity issues
- **Evidence:** `apps/api/src/controllers/authController.ts:11-15`
- **Requirement Violated:** Coding standards - "All user inputs must be validated before processing"
- **Fix Required:** Implement comprehensive validation schemas

#### 3. Weak Secret Management (MEDIUM)
- **Issue:** Hardcoded JWT secret fallback
- **Risk:** Token forgery if secret not set
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access
- **Evidence:** `apps/api/src/services/authService.ts:29`
- **Fix Required:** Remove fallback, fail fast if not set

#### 4. Insufficient Rate Limiting (MEDIUM)
- **Issue:** Generic rate limit (100 req/15min) for auth
- **Risk:** Brute force attacks
- **Impact:** Account compromise
- **Evidence:** `apps/api/src/server.ts:28`
- **Fix Required:** Add stricter auth-specific rate limiting (5 req/15min)

### Security Strengths

✅ **Good Practices Implemented:**
- Password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- CORS properly configured
- Helmet security headers
- HTTPS/TLS with strong ciphers (TLS 1.2/1.3)
- JWT token expiration (1 hour)
- Refresh token pattern
- Role-based access control
- Structured audit logging
- httpOnly cookies configured on backend

### Security Test Coverage

- ✅ Authentication flow tests (login, logout, token refresh)
- ✅ Authorization tests (role-based access)
- ✅ Protected route tests
- ❌ Missing: XSS vulnerability tests
- ❌ Missing: CSRF protection tests

**Score:** 85/100  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

### Performance Requirements

| Requirement | Status | Evidence | Notes |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------|
| Response Time | ✅ PASS | < 200ms for auth endpoints | Measured in tests |

| Resource Usage | ✅ PASS | Memory monitoring implemented | Health check includes metrics |
| Scalability | ✅ PASS | Stateless architecture | Horizontal scaling ready |
| Database Performance | ✅ PASS | Proper indexes, connection pooling | Optimized queries |
| Caching | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Redis infrastructure ready | Not yet implemented |

### Performance Strengths

✅ **Good Practices Implemented:**
- Database connection pooling (max 20, idle timeout 30s)
- Proper indexes on frequently queried columns (users.email, users.tenant_id, etc.)
- Redis infrastructure ready for caching
- Efficient query patterns (single JOIN for user auth)
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Stateless API design (horizontal scaling ready)
- Response compression ready (nginx gzip)

### Performance Concerns

⚠️ **Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Permission Caching:** User permissions queried on every authorization check
   - Current: Database query per authorization

2. **Query Performance Monitoring:** No query performance logging
   - Recommendation: Add query duration logging
   - Impact: Identify slow queries early

3. **Connection Pool Monitoring:** No metrics on pool usage
   - Recommendation: Add pool metrics to health check
   - Impact: Detect connection exhaustion early

### Performance Test Coverage

- ✅ Basic response time validation in E2E tests
- ❌ Missing: Load tests for auth endpoints
- ❌ Missing: Stress tests for database connections
- ❌ Missing: Performance regression tests
- ❌ Missing: Scalability tests

### Performance Recommendations

**Short-term:**
1. Implement permission caching in Redis
2. Add query performance logging
3. Add connection pool monitoring
4. Add performance tests for auth endpoints

**Long-term:**
5. Implement comprehensive load testing
6. Add APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
7. Implement query optimization monitoring
8. Add performance budgets to CI/CD
