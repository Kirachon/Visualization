## Detailed Risk Analysis

### R1: XSS Token Theft via localStorage (CRITICAL) üö®

**Probability:** HIGH (4/5)  
**Impact:** CRITICAL (5/5)  
**Risk Score:** 20

**Description:**  
JWT tokens stored in localStorage are accessible to any JavaScript code running on the page, including malicious scripts injected through XSS attacks. This creates a direct path for attackers to steal authentication tokens and impersonate users.

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Attacker injects malicious script through XSS vulnerability (e.g., in dashboard name, comment, etc.)
2. Script reads `localStorage.getItem('token')`
3. Script sends token to attacker's server
4. Attacker uses stolen token to impersonate user

**Evidence:**
- `apps/web/src/services/api.ts:16` - `localStorage.getItem('token')`
- `apps/web/src/services/authService.ts:11-14` - `localStorage.setItem('token', ...)`
- Story security requirements (line 342) explicitly require httpOnly cookies

**Current Mitigation:** None ‚ùå

**Required Mitigation:**
1. Remove all localStorage token operations
2. Rely exclusively on httpOnly cookies (already implemented on backend)
3. Update token refresh logic to use cookie-based authentication
4. Add XSS protection tests

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** LOW (2/5) - httpOnly cookies prevent JavaScript access

### R2: Injection Attacks (SQL, XSS, Command Injection)

**Probability:** MEDIUM (3/5)  
**Impact:** HIGH (4/5)  
**Risk Score:** 12

**Description:**  
Missing input validation schemas create opportunities for various injection attacks. While SQL injection is mitigated through parameterized queries, other injection vectors remain.

**Attack Scenarios:**
1. **SQL Injection:** Mitigated ‚úÖ (parameterized queries used throughout)
2. **XSS Injection:** Possible through unvalidated user inputs (dashboard names, descriptions, etc.)
3. **Command Injection:** Possible if user input reaches shell commands
4. **NoSQL Injection:** Not applicable (PostgreSQL used)

**Evidence:**
- `apps/api/src/controllers/authController.ts:11-15` - Basic null checks only
- Missing Joi/Zod validation schemas
- No input sanitization middleware

**Current Mitigation:** Partial ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ‚úÖ SQL injection prevented through parameterized queries
- ‚ùå No input validation schemas
- ‚ùå No input sanitization
- ‚úÖ React provides some XSS protection (auto-escaping)

**Required Mitigation:**
1. Implement Joi or Zod validation schemas for all API inputs
2. Add validation middleware to all routes
3. Sanitize user inputs before storage
4. Add security tests for injection attacks

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** LOW (2/5) - Comprehensive validation reduces attack surface

### R3: Brute Force Authentication Attacks

**Probability:** MEDIUM (3/5)  
**Impact:** MEDIUM (3/5)  
**Risk Score:** 9

**Description:**  
Current rate limiting (100 requests/15 minutes) is insufficient for authentication endpoints. Attackers can attempt multiple password combinations to compromise accounts.

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Attacker identifies valid usernames (e.g., 'admin', 'viewer')
2. Attacker attempts 100 password combinations in 15 minutes
3. Attacker waits 15 minutes and repeats
4. Eventually compromises weak passwords

**Evidence:**
- `apps/api/src/server.ts:28` - Generic rate limiter (100 req/15min)
- No specific rate limiting for `/api/v1/auth/login`
- No account lockout mechanism
- No CAPTCHA or similar challenge

**Current Mitigation:** Partial ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ‚úÖ Basic rate limiting exists (100 req/15min)
- ‚ùå Not strict enough for auth endpoints
- ‚ùå No account lockout
- ‚ùå No progressive delays

**Required Mitigation:**
1. Add stricter rate limiting for auth endpoints (5 attempts/15min)
2. Implement account lockout after N failed attempts
3. Add progressive delays (exponential backoff)
4. Consider CAPTCHA for repeated failures
5. Log and alert on brute force attempts

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** LOW (2/5) - Strict rate limiting makes brute force impractical

---

### R4: JWT Secret Compromise

**Probability:** LOW (2/5)  
**Impact:** HIGH (4/5)  
**Risk Score:** 8

**Description:**  
Hardcoded fallback JWT secret ('your-super-secret-jwt-key') could be used if environment variable is not set, allowing attackers to forge valid tokens.

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Application deployed without JWT_SECRET environment variable
2. Application uses default secret
3. Attacker discovers default secret (public in code)
4. Attacker forges valid JWT tokens
5. Attacker gains unauthorized access to any account

**Evidence:**
- `apps/api/src/services/authService.ts:29` - `|| 'your-super-secret-jwt-key'`
- Default secret is visible in source code

**Current Mitigation:** Partial ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ‚úÖ Environment variable exists in .env.example
- ‚ùå Fallback to default secret if not set
- ‚ùå No validation that secret is strong enough

**Required Mitigation:**
1. Remove fallback - fail fast if JWT_SECRET not set
2. Add startup validation for JWT_SECRET presence
3. Add validation for secret strength (minimum length, entropy)
4. Document secret rotation procedures

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** VERY LOW (1/5) - No fallback forces proper configuration

### R5: Docker Configuration Errors

**Probability:** LOW (2/5)  
**Impact:** MEDIUM (3/5)  
**Risk Score:** 6

**Description:**  
Misconfigured Docker services could lead to service unavailability, data loss, or security vulnerabilities.

**Potential Issues:**
- Services fail to start
- Network connectivity issues between containers
- Volume mount problems causing data loss
- Exposed ports creating security vulnerabilities

**Evidence:**
- `infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml` - Comprehensive configuration
- Health checks configured for all services
- Proper network isolation
- Volume mounts for data persistence

**Current Mitigation:** Good ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Health checks for all services
- ‚úÖ Proper network configuration
- ‚úÖ Volume mounts for data persistence
- ‚úÖ Environment variables properly configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual testing required (not automated)

**Required Mitigation:**
1. Add automated Docker stack tests
2. Add smoke tests after container startup
3. Document troubleshooting procedures
4. Add monitoring for container health

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** VERY LOW (1/5) - Automated tests catch configuration issues early

### R6: Database Connection Failures

**Probability:** LOW (2/5)  
**Impact:** HIGH (4/5)  
**Risk Score:** 8

**Description:**  
Database connection failures could cause service outages and data inconsistencies.

**Potential Issues:**
- Connection pool exhaustion
- Network connectivity issues
- Database server failures
- Transaction deadlocks

**Evidence:**
- `apps/api/src/database/connection.ts` - Connection pooling configured
- Health check endpoint tests database connectivity
- Proper error handling for database operations
- Transaction support implemented

**Current Mitigation:** Excellent ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Connection pooling (max 20 connections)
- ‚úÖ Connection timeout (2 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Idle timeout (30 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoint
- ‚úÖ Transaction support
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling

**Required Mitigation:**
1. Add retry logic for transient failures
2. Add circuit breaker pattern
3. Add connection pool monitoring
4. Add database failover configuration

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** VERY LOW (1/5) - Comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## Risk Acceptance

**Can this story be accepted with current risks?** ‚ùå **NO**

**Rationale:**
- R1 (XSS Token Theft) is CRITICAL and must be fixed
- R2 (Injection Attacks) is HIGH and must be addressed
- Both risks directly contradict story security requirements
- Accepting these risks would violate security best practices

**Conditions for Acceptance:**
1. R1 (XSS Token Theft) must be fixed
2. R2 (Injection Attacks) must be addressed with validation schemas
3. Security tests must verify fixes
4. QA must re-review and approve

---

## Conclusion

This story demonstrates **excellent architectural work** but contains **critical security vulnerabilities** that must be addressed before production deployment. The good news is that fixes are straightforward and the backend already implements secure patterns (httpOnly cookies).

**Estimated time to mitigate critical risks:** 4-6 hours

**Recommendation:** Fix critical security issues, then this story will be ready for production with LOW residual risk.
