## Verification Results

### ✅ Fix #1: localStorage Token Storage (CRITICAL) - VERIFIED

**Original Issue:** JWT tokens stored in localStorage, creating XSS vulnerability  
**Risk Score:** 20/25 (CRITICAL)  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Verification:**
- ✅ All localStorage operations removed from frontend
- ✅ Frontend relies exclusively on httpOnly cookies
- ✅ Backend refresh endpoint reads from cookies
- ✅ Automatic cookie transmission with withCredentials: true

**Files Verified:**
- `apps/web/src/services/api.ts` - No localStorage usage ✅
- `apps/web/src/services/authService.ts` - No localStorage usage ✅
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - refresh() updated ✅
- `apps/api/src/controllers/authController.ts` - Reads from req.cookies ✅

**Security Impact:** XSS token theft risk eliminated (20 → 2)

---

### ✅ Fix #2: Input Validation Schemas (CRITICAL) - VERIFIED

**Original Issue:** No input validation schemas, only basic null checks  
**Risk Score:** 12/25 (HIGH)  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Verification:**
- ✅ Comprehensive Joi validation schemas created
- ✅ Reusable validation middleware implemented
- ✅ Validation applied to authentication endpoints
- ✅ 17 new tests added (10 schema + 4 middleware + 3 E2E)

**Validation Rules Verified:**
- ✅ Username: 3-30 chars, alphanumeric only
- ✅ Password: min 8 chars, must contain letter + number
- ✅ Custom error messages for better UX
- ✅ stripUnknown: true (security by default)

**Files Verified:**
- `apps/api/src/validators/authValidators.ts` - Comprehensive schemas ✅
- `apps/api/src/middleware/validate.ts` - Reusable middleware ✅
- `apps/api/src/routes/authRoutes.ts` - Validation applied ✅
- `apps/api/src/validators/__tests__/authValidators.test.ts` - 10 tests ✅
- `apps/api/src/middleware/__tests__/validate.test.ts` - 4 tests ✅

**Security Impact:** Injection attack surface significantly reduced (12 → 2)

---

### ✅ Fix #3: JWT_SECRET Fallback (HIGH) - VERIFIED

**Original Issue:** Hardcoded JWT secret fallback allowed insecure default  
**Risk Score:** 8/25 (MEDIUM)  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Verification:**
- ✅ Fallback removed completely
- ✅ Fail-fast validation added
- ✅ Application throws error on startup if JWT_SECRET not set

**Code Verified:**
```typescript
const JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
if (!JWT_SECRET) {
  throw new Error('CRITICAL: JWT_SECRET environment variable is required but not set');
}
```

**Files Verified:**
- `apps/api/src/services/authService.ts` - Fail-fast validation ✅

**Security Impact:** JWT secret compromise risk eliminated (8 → 1)

---

### ✅ Fix #4: Auth Rate Limiting (HIGH) - VERIFIED

**Original Issue:** Generic rate limit (100 req/15min) insufficient for auth  
**Risk Score:** 9/25 (MEDIUM)  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Verification:**
- ✅ Dedicated loginLimiter created (5 attempts/15min)
- ✅ skipSuccessfulRequests: true (only counts failures)
- ✅ Custom error message for rate limit exceeded
- ✅ Applied to login endpoint

**Configuration Verified:**
```typescript
const loginLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5, // 5 attempts per IP
  message: 'Too many login attempts from this IP, please try again after 15 minutes.',
  skipSuccessfulRequests: true,
});
```

**Files Verified:**
- `apps/api/src/routes/authRoutes.ts` - Rate limiter applied ✅

**Security Impact:** Brute force attack risk significantly reduced (9 → 2)
